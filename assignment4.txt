1.
You can concatenate strings in C by either using the strcat function, or by
making two arrays and not putting a value in, and using indexing to replace
the first string's '\0' with the beginning of the next string.

2.
If an array is not initialized, the size will be automatically set to the 
number of values already in the array. 
Ex. int arr[] = {1,2,3};
The size will be automatically set to 3.
If the array has a size, but no values in it, the values will be set to zero.
Ex. int arr[3]= {};

3.
You would declare a multidimensional array of size 64 by making a int array
with the numbers in [][] being able to multiple to 64, such as 8 and 8.

4.
strcmp() compares one string to another one. It returns 0 if the strings are
the same, returns a positive number if the second string comes before the
first string in lexiographic order, and returns a negative number if the 
first string comes before the second string in lexographic order.

fgets() reads string input and returns the string that was inputed. It 
however reads the '\n', and not the string terminator.

strcat() concatenates two strings and returns the combination of the two 
strings.

strlen() gets and returns the length of a string excluding '\0'.
